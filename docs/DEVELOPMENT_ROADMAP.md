# Development Roadmap
# NaaS Pricing Calculator - Stepwise Refinement Strategy

**Version:** 2.0
**Methodology:** Stepwise Refinement with Phased Deployment
**Last Updated:** January 2025

---

## Stepwise Refinement Philosophy

This roadmap follows the **stepwise refinement** methodology, progressively elaborating the system from a working core (v1.0) to a complete enterprise solution (v2.0). Each phase:

1. **Builds on the previous** - No breaking changes, only additions
2. **Delivers value independently** - Each phase is production-ready
3. **Maintains stability** - Existing functionality remains intact
4. **Validates before proceeding** - User feedback guides next steps

## Development Phases Overview

```
v1.0 (COMPLETE) ──► v1.1 (Q1 2025) ──► v1.5 (Q2 2025) ──► v2.0 (Q3-Q4 2025)
    85%                 92%                 96%                 100%+

Core System      Critical Fixes    Advanced Features   Enterprise Platform
```

## Phase 0: Foundation - v1.0 ✅ COMPLETE (Q4 2024)

### Objectives
- Replicate core Excel spreadsheet functionality
- Establish architecture patterns
- Deliver production-ready MVP

### Deliverables ✅
- [x] 15 core pricing components
- [x] Dependency-based calculation engine
- [x] Real-time calculation orchestration
- [x] Component and wizard UIs
- [x] Quote history and management
- [x] Import/export (Excel, CSV, JSON)
- [x] Auto-save and persistence
- [x] Responsive design with dark theme
- [x] Basic accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [x] Comprehensive error handling

### Current State (January 2025)

**What's Working:**
- Core calculation engine (85% Excel parity)
- All 15 component pricing system
- Dependency graph and orchestrator
- Quote wizard workflow
- localStorage persistence
- Responsive UI with dark theme
- Excel/CSV import/export (SheetJS)

**Test Status:**
- Unit tests: Passing (security.test.js, error-handler.test.js)
- E2E tests: Not currently configured for CI
- Test coverage: Limited to critical utility functions
- Integration tests: Pending implementation

**Performance Metrics:**
- **Calculation Accuracy:** ~85% match with Excel (minor discount logic differences)
- **Component Coverage:** 15/15 implemented
- **Test Coverage:** ~15% unit tests (primarily security & error handling)
- **Performance:** <500ms average calculation time (meets target)
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance (aria labels, keyboard nav implemented)

### Known Technical Debt
- **Testing:** E2E tests exist but not integrated into CI/CD
- **Security:** XSS protection partially implemented (needs DOMPurify integration audit)
- **Geographic pricing:** Not implemented
- **Risk assessment:** Missing
- **Equipment lifecycle tracking:** Absent
- **Backend infrastructure:** No server-side components
- **TypeScript/React scaffolding:** Exists but not wired up (see TECHNICAL_DEBT.md)

### Stepwise Refinement Approach

#### Iteration 1.1.1: Geographic Pricing (Weeks 1-2)
**Focus:** Location-based cost adjustments

**Step 1 - Data Layer:**
```javascript
// Week 1, Days 1-2: Add location data structures
class GeographicCalculator {
    locationMultipliers = {
        'CA': 1.25, 'NY': 1.25, 'MA': 1.20,
        'TX': 1.00, 'FL': 1.00, 'Standard': 1.00
    };
    taxRates = {
        'CA': 0.0875, 'NY': 0.08, 'TX': 0.0625
    };
}
```

**Step 2 - Calculation Integration:**
```javascript
// Week 1, Days 3-5: Integrate with existing calculations
calculateWithLocation(baseResult, location) {
    const multiplier = this.getLocationMultiplier(location);
    const tax = this.calculateSalesTax(baseResult.oneTime, location);
    return {
        ...baseResult,
        totals: {
            ...baseResult.totals,
            oneTime: baseResult.totals.oneTime + tax,
            monthly: baseResult.totals.monthly * multiplier
        },
        adjustments: { location, multiplier, tax }
    };
}
```

**Step 3 - UI Components:**
```javascript
// Week 2, Days 1-3: Add location selector to quote wizard
<div class="form-group">
    <label>Project Location</label>

    }
}
```

**Step 2 - Quote Integration:**
```javascript

        const months = this.refreshSchedules[category] || 36;
        const inflationRate = 0.03;
        const years = months / 12;
        return equipment.cost * Math.pow(1 + inflationRate, years);
    }

    calculateObsolescenceReserve(totalCost) {
        return totalCost * 0.15; // 15% reserve
    }
}
```

**Step 2 - Capital Equipment Integration:**
```javascript
