# üéØ **Exact Spreadsheet Replication Plan**

## **Objective: Replicate ONLY What's Currently in the Spreadsheet**

This plan focuses on ensuring the web app **exactly matches** the current spreadsheet functionality - no more, no less.

## üìä **Current Web App vs Spreadsheet Analysis**

### **‚úÖ What's Already Working in Web App**
Based on my code review, the web app currently has:

1. **PRTG Monitoring** - Sensor tiers, service levels, setup costs
2. **Capital Equipment** - Equipment catalog, APR financing (5%)
3. **Support Services** - Multiple tiers, CPI escalation (3%)
4. **Onboarding** - Complexity-based pricing, assessments
5. **PBS Foundation** - Platform services, feature add-ons
6. **Assessment** - Network assessment services
7. **Admin Services** - Administrative and review services
8. **Other Costs** - Additional equipment and services
9. **Enhanced Support** - Premium support services
10. **Dynamics (1, 3, 5 Year)** - Dynamic calculation components
11. **NaaS Packages** - Standard and Enhanced packages
12. **Help & Instructions** - User guide component

### **‚ùì What We Need to Verify**

To ensure exact replication, we need to:

1. **Compare each calculation** in the web app with the spreadsheet
2. **Verify all formulas** match exactly
3. **Check all pricing data** is identical
4. **Ensure all components** are included
5. **Validate all business logic** is the same

## üîç **Verification Process**

### **Step 1: Component-by-Component Verification**

Let me check each component calculation against the spreadsheet:

#### **PRTG Monitoring**
- [ ] Verify sensor tier pricing matches spreadsheet
- [ ] Check service level costs are identical
- [ ] Confirm setup costs match exactly
- [ ] Validate location and alert recipient calculations

#### **Capital Equipment**
- [ ] Verify equipment catalog prices match spreadsheet
- [ ] Check APR calculation (5%) is correct
- [ ] Confirm financing formulas match
- [ ] Validate equipment categories

#### **Support Services**
- [ ] Verify support tier pricing matches spreadsheet
- [ ] Check CPI escalation (3%) calculation
- [ ] Confirm device count scaling
- [ ] Validate service level variations

#### **Onboarding**
- [ ] Verify complexity pricing matches spreadsheet
- [ ] Check site multiplier calculations
- [ ] Confirm assessment cost integration
- [ ] Validate custom services pricing

#### **PBS Foundation**
- [ ] Verify base pricing matches spreadsheet
- [ ] Check user/location scaling
- [ ] Confirm feature pricing
- [ ] Validate add-on costs

### **Step 2: Formula Verification**

For each calculation, verify:
- [ ] **Mathematical formulas** match spreadsheet exactly
- [ ] **Pricing constants** are identical
- [ ] **Calculation logic** is the same
- [ ] **Rounding rules** match spreadsheet
- [ ] **Error handling** matches spreadsheet behavior

### **Step 3: Data Structure Verification**

- [ ] **Pricing data** matches spreadsheet values
- [ ] **Default parameters** are identical
- [ ] **Configuration constants** match
- [ ] **Equipment catalog** is complete and accurate

## üö® **Potential Issues to Check**

### **1. Calculation Accuracy**
- Are the APR calculations using the exact same formula as the spreadsheet?
- Is the CPI escalation calculation identical?
- Do the volume discount calculations match?

### **2. Missing Components**
- Are all 15 components from the spreadsheet included?
- Are there any hidden calculations in the spreadsheet we missed?
- Are there any cross-component dependencies we didn't implement?

### **3. Pricing Data**
- Do all the pricing constants match the spreadsheet exactly?
- Are there any equipment types or service levels missing?
- Do the default values match the spreadsheet defaults?

### **4. Business Logic**
- Are all the conditional calculations implemented?
- Do the discount rules match exactly?
- Are there any special cases or edge conditions we missed?

## üîß **Implementation Plan**

### **Phase 1: Verification (1-2 days)**
1. **Upload the spreadsheet** to the analysis tool I created
2. **Compare each calculation** component by component
3. **Identify any discrepancies** between web app and spreadsheet
4. **Document exact differences** found

### **Phase 2: Fixes (2-3 days)**
1. **Fix any calculation errors** found in verification
2. **Add any missing components** identified
3. **Correct any pricing data** discrepancies
4. **Update any business logic** that doesn't match

### **Phase 3: Validation (1 day)**
1. **Test all calculations** against spreadsheet values
2. **Verify all scenarios** work identically
3. **Confirm 100% accuracy** with spreadsheet
4. **Document final verification** results

## üìã **Action Items**

### **Immediate Next Steps:**
1. **Use the spreadsheet analysis tool** to examine the actual spreadsheet
2. **Compare web app calculations** with spreadsheet formulas
3. **Identify any gaps** or discrepancies
4. **Fix only what's different** from the spreadsheet

### **Success Criteria:**
- [ ] All calculations match spreadsheet exactly
- [ ] All pricing data is identical
- [ ] All components are included
- [ ] All business logic matches
- [ ] Test results are 100% accurate

## üéØ **What This Means**

Instead of adding new functionality, we're focusing on:
- **Verification** - Making sure what we have is correct
- **Correction** - Fixing any errors or missing pieces
- **Validation** - Confirming 100% accuracy with spreadsheet

The goal is to have a web app that works **exactly** like the spreadsheet, with no differences in calculations, pricing, or functionality.

Would you like me to start by using the spreadsheet analysis tool to examine the actual spreadsheet and compare it with our current web app implementation?
